# TodoListApplication

### Project Brief: Java Spring Boot Todo
List API
Objective
Develop a backend API for a Todo list application using Spring Boot. The emphasis is on core
Java web development concepts, API design (REST or gRPC), and thorough testing practices.

### Time Expectation
This exercise should not take more than 4-5 hours to complete.

### Requirements
#### Todo Resource
Define a Todo resource model (properties like id, description, completion status)
#### API Endpoints
- RESTful API (Mandatory)
- GET /todos (retrieve all todos)
- GET /todos/{id} (retrieve a single todo)
- POST /todos (create a todo)
- PATCH /todos/{id} (update a todo)
- DELETE /todos/{id} (delete a todo)
#### gRPC API (Bonus)
Implement the equivalent list of operations above using gRPC.
#### Persistence
Use an SQLite database for persistence. Use JDBC and SQL for database
interactions.

### Technical Considerations
- Spring Boot and Spring MVC: Structure the web application, and use Spring MVC to
implement the REST API endpoints.
- gRPC (Bonus): If youâ€™re pursuing the bonus, use gRPC-Java to define services and
generate the necessary code for the gRPC API.
- Testing
- Unit Tests (JUnit): Thoroughly test API controllers, service layers, and any data
access logic.
- Integration Tests: Test the API endpoints and their interaction with the SQLite
database.
- Code Quality: Clean, well-structured code following Java best practices.
- Error Handling: Implement meaningful error handling and response codes within the
API.
### Evaluation Criteria
- Functionality: Does the API meet the specified requirements?
- API Design: Is the REST API well-structured? If gRPC is included, is it implemented
correctly using gRPC principles?
- Database Interaction: Effective use of JDBC and SQL with SQLite.
- Testing: Thoroughness of unit and integration tests, ensuring good code coverage.
